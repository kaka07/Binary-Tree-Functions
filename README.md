# Binary-Tree-Functions

All in one guide for all the basic functions implemented using binary tree. 
(i)->Creating a tree.
(ii)->Insertion of a node in the existing tree.
(iii)->Traversal:-
  (a)Inorder Traversal.
  (b)Preorder Traversal.
  (c)Postorder Traversal.
  (d)Level Order Traversal.
  (e)Reverse Level Order Traversal.
(iv)->Calculating height of the tree.
(v)->Searching for a particular key.
(vi)->Check if the tree is balanced or not.
(vii)->Minimum and Maximum value
